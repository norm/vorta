A base class for building python Slack bots. 

Rather than writing your code as a plugin that predominantly reacts to events
and run methods on a schedule (the technique used by [rtmbot]), write your
code more directly.

Also contains a bunch of convenience functions for common operations (such
as turning a channel ID into its human-readable name).
